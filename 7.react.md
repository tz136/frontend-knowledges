### 1. What is React?

**Answer:** React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. React's main goal is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application, which corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

### 2. What are Components in React?

**Answer:** Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. They are essentially JavaScript classes or functions that accept inputs, called `props`, and return React elements that describe how a section of the UI should appear. The main advantage of components is that they allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be handled separately.

### 3. What is JSX?

**Answer:** JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for writing React elements. JSX combines the power of JavaScript with HTML like template syntax. This syntax is then transformed into JavaScript calls of the React framework. Though not required, JSX is used because it is easier to write and understand compared to pure JavaScript.

### 4. Explain the Virtual DOM.

**Answer:** The Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is a concept where a virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM by libraries such as ReactDOM. This process is known as reconciliation. It allows React to update the DOM nodes efficiently by changing only what needs to be changed, rather than updating the entire DOM. This leads to significant performance improvements and a simpler programming model.

### 5. What are Props?

**Answer:** Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components in React. They are read-only and help to create dynamic and interactive components by allowing immutable data to be shared across them.

### 6. What is State?

**Answer:** State is a built-in React object used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders. The change in state can happen as a response to user actions or system events. It is what makes React components dynamic and interactive.

### 7. Explain the Lifecycle of a React Component.

**Answer:** Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

-   **Mounting:** The component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
-   **Updating:** The component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
-   **Unmounting:** The component is being removed from the DOM.

React class components provide lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount`) for executing code at particular times in this lifecycle.

### 8. What are Hooks?

**Answer:** Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. They do not work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. Commonly used hooks are `useState` and `useEffect`.

### 9. Explain the use of `useState` and `useEffect`.

**Answer:**

-   **useState** is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
-   **useEffect** is a Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components. It is a close replacement for `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes. It can be used to fetch data, directly update the DOM, and perform cleanups.

### 10. What is Redux?

**Answer:** Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Redux is based on the Flux design pattern and helps in maintaining the state of an entire application in a single immutable state object. It provides a predictable way of managing state through a strict unidirectional data flow.
