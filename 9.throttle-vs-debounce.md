# Throttle
In JavaScript, throttling is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function can be executed. It ensures that a function is not invoked more than once within a specified time interval, even if it is called multiple times during that interval.

```js
function throttle(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;
  let lastExecTime = 0;

  return function(...args) {
    const currentTime = Date.now();
    const elapsedTime = currentTime - lastExecTime;

    if (!timeoutId || elapsedTime >= delay) {
      func.apply(this, args);
      lastExecTime = currentTime;
    } else {
      clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
        func.apply(this, args);
        lastExecTime = Date.now();
      }, delay - elapsedTime);
    }
  };
}

// Example usage:
function someFunction() {
  console.log('Function executed');
}

const throttledFunction = throttle(someFunction, 1000);

// Call the throttled function multiple times
throttledFunction(); // This will execute immediately
throttledFunction(); // This will be throttled and executed after 1000 ms
throttledFunction(); // This will be throttled and executed after 1000 ms
```

In this implementation:

-   The `throttle` function takes two parameters: `func`, the function to be throttled, and `delay`, the time interval in milliseconds.
-   Inside the returned function, we check whether the elapsed time since the last execution of `func` is greater than or equal to the specified `delay`.
-   If the elapsed time is greater than or equal to the delay, we execute the function immediately and update the last execution time.
-   If the elapsed time is less than the delay, we clear any existing timeout and schedule the function to be executed after the remaining time in the delay interval.
-   This ensures that the function is not executed more frequently than the specified delay.

# Debounce
In JavaScript, debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is called. It ensures that a function is only executed after a certain amount of time has passed since the last invocation. This is particularly useful for scenarios like handling user input events such as keystrokes or window resize events.

```JS
function debounce(func, delay) {
  let timeoutId;

  return function(...args) {
    const context = this;

    clearTimeout(timeoutId);

    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      func.apply(context, args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

// Example usage:
function someFunction() {
  console.log('Function executed');
}

const debouncedFunction = debounce(someFunction, 1000);

// Call the debounced function multiple times
debouncedFunction(); // This will be debounced and executed after 1000 ms
debouncedFunction(); // This will cancel the previous invocation and schedule a new one
debouncedFunction(); // This will also cancel the previous invocation and schedule a new one
```

In this implementation:

-   The `debounce` function takes two parameters: `func`, the function to be debounced, and `delay`, the time interval in milliseconds.
-   Inside the returned function, we clear any existing timeout to cancel the previous invocation of `func`.
-   We then schedule a new timeout to execute `func` after the specified `delay`. If the function is called again within the delay period, the previous invocation will be canceled, and a new timeout will be scheduled.
-   This ensures that the function is only executed once after the specified delay has passed since the last invocation.
