The MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern is a fundamental principle in software design, dividing an application into three interconnected components. This separation helps manage complexity, enhances scalability, and facilitates maintenance. The Model represents the application's data structure, the View displays the data (the user interface), and the Controller handles the input, processing it to the Model and View. This pattern is widely used in web applications to create efficient, organized code structures that improve development and user experience.

Object-oriented design (OOD) focuses on designing software by defining types of objects and their interactions to solve a problem. It promotes code reusability through inheritance and encapsulation. Memory management is crucial in OOD to ensure efficient resource use and prevent leaks. Performance optimization in OOD involves refining algorithms, minimizing memory usage, and enhancing execution speed. Techniques include code profiling, optimizing data structures, and leveraging design patterns that reduce computational overhead. Balancing these aspects leads to robust, efficient applications.

Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) is Apple's low-level API for managing concurrent operations in iOS and macOS applications. It allows developers to execute multi-threaded, asynchronous code efficiently by managing a pool of threads and distributing work across available resources. GCD simplifies the process of executing tasks concurrently, optimizing application performance and responsiveness without the complexity of directly managing threads.
