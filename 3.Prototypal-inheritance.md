## What is Prototypal Inheritance? How does it work?

Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This model is different from the classical inheritance model found in languages like Java or C++, where classes inherit from other classes. In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved through prototypesâ€”a mechanism where objects can have a prototype object that acts as a template from which they can inherit properties and methods.

### How Prototypal Inheritance Works:

1.  **Every JavaScript object has a property called `[[Prototype]]`** (often accessed via `Object.getPrototypeOf()` or the `__proto__` property, although the latter is deprecated and not recommended for use in modern code). This `[[Prototype]]` property is a reference to another object (the prototype object) from which the object can inherit properties and methods.
    
2.  **When you try to access a property or method of an object**, JavaScript first checks if that property/method exists on the object itself. If not found, JavaScript looks at the object's prototype (`[[Prototype]]`), then the prototype's prototype, and so on, up the prototype chain until it finds the property/method or reaches the end of the chain (which will be `null`).
    
3.  **Function constructors and the `new` keyword**: When you create an object using a constructor function and the `new` keyword, the newly created object's `[[Prototype]]` is set to the constructor function's `prototype` property. This means the new object inherits from the constructor function's prototype.
    
4.  **The `Object.create()` method** allows for the creation of a new object with a specified prototype object and properties. This method provides a clear way to create an object that directly inherits from another object.

### Example of Prototypal Inheritance:
```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
}

function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Call the parent constructor with `this` context and arguments
}

// Set Dog's prototype to be an instance of Animal
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Set the constructor property on Dog's prototype to refer to Dog
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

// Add method to Dog's prototype
Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
```
In this example:

-   `Dog` inherits from `Animal` using prototypal inheritance.
-   The `speak` method is overridden in `Dog`'s prototype to provide a different implementation from the one inherited from `Animal`.
-   When `dog.speak()` is called, JavaScript first looks for the `speak` method on the `dog` object itself. Not finding it there, it looks up the prototype chain, finds the `speak` method on `Dog.prototype`, and calls it.

Prototypal inheritance is a powerful and flexible feature of JavaScript, enabling complex inheritance structures to be built in a simple and dynamic way.
